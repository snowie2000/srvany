# srvany
My delphi version of srvany.

Better memory consumption, no dependencies!

Builtin service builder, no xml configuration required anymore.

## Dependency
I knew that there are many files missing, they are from my company's repos which I can't upload.

But they are relatively simple to implement. So, do it yourself~ 

Good luck!
